# OptiCustomer – Customer Optimization & Impact Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard that helps businesses understand which customers create value, which drain resources, and how much improvement is possible by fixing product friction.

This project helps a business understand:
- Which customers bring high value
- Which customers consume high effort
- Where to focus time and money for maximum growth

The dashboard answers one simple question:

> “Which customers should we invest in, and which ones are costing us more than they return?”

## 1️⃣ Customer Optimization Map

Each dot is one customer.

- Left side = low effort customers  
- Right side = high effort customers  
- Top = high value  
- Bottom = low value  

This creates 4 clear groups:

- **Champions** – High value, low effort  
- **Growth Potential** – High value, high effort  
- **Drainers** – Low value, high effort  
- **Low Impact** – Low value, low effort  

This view helps the company *instantly* see where every customer stands.

## 2️⃣ Value & Effort by Segment

These charts answer two business questions:

- Which group gives us the most value?
- Which group consumes the most effort?

For example:
- *Growth Potential* customers create the highest value  
- *Drainers* consume effort but return low value  

This tells managers where money and support time are being wasted.

## 3️⃣ Segment Behavior Breakdown

This view shows **why** a segment behaves this way:

- Failed actions  
- Successful actions  
- Returns  
- Support tickets  

Now the company understands:
- What problems each group faces  
- What to fix first

## 4️⃣ Optimization Impact Simulator

This section answers:

> “What happens if we fix these problems?”

Using sliders, we simulate improvements like:
- Fewer failed actions  
- Fewer support tickets  
- Better success rate  

The dashboard shows:
- New projected value  
- Net gain after optimization  

This turns the dashboard from *reporting* into *decision making*.
