## What This Project Does

The dashboard models customers across two dimensions:

- **Value** – how much benefit a customer brings
- **Effort** – how much operational cost a customer creates

Customers are segmented into:

| Segment | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Champion | High value, low effort |
| Growth Potential | Low value, low effort |
| High Value – High Effort | Important but costly |
| Drainer | Low value, high effort |

---

## Dashboard Components

1. Customer Optimization Map (Value vs Effort)
2. Value Contribution by Segment
3. Effort Consumption by Segment
4. Segment Behavior Breakdown
5. Optimization Impact Simulator (with Value Gained)

The dashboard allows decision-makers to:
- Identify loss-making customer patterns
- Understand behavior behind poor performance
- Simulate business impact of product improvements
- Decide where to invest resources
